Node.js HTTP Proxy Agents Monorepo
==================================
[![Build Status](https://github.com/odczynflnpm/et-eius-magnam/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/odczynflnpm/et-eius-magnam/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This monorepo contains various Node.js HTTP Agent implementations that operate over proxies using various protocols.

For the most common use-cases, you should be using the [`@odczynflnpm/et-eius-magnam`](./packages/@odczynflnpm/et-eius-magnam) module, which utilizes the other, more low-level, agent implementations.

You can find [changelogs here](CHANGELOG.md).
